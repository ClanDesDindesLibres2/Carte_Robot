# Robotic Arm's code with OpenCR
Open CR's purpose is to move the different motors on the robotic arm. The velocity and acceleration of the motors can be change to adjust the different movements of the robotic arm. To do so, many libraries are used such as *Dynamixel WorkBench* and *Board OpenCR*. 

The robotic arm moves with certain position that are hard coded in the code of OpenCR. The hard coded postions can be found in the .cpp file. Each position are  found, teach and put in a matrice. The positions include a pick up and a drop of the different chess pieces of the game.
